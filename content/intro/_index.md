We have deep expertise in human-centric image and video understanding, with core capabilities covering human segmentation, pose estimation, attribute prediction and re-identification. At present, we are focusing on the integration of artificial intelligence technology with cutting-edge platforms such as drones, embodied agents and satellite remote sensing.
